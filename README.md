critical_equip
-Counts the number of Non-mission capable critical equipment pieces present in a battalion's equipment status report (ESR). Rather than take on average 30 minutes to an hour scrubbing an ESR, once you set this script up to your liking, this whole process can be cut down to a couple of seconds saving the end user needed man hours to attend to other maintenance matters. 

For maintenance_alerts, it will grab a commonly formatted tracker that contains administrative data of personnel at the battalion level and advise you x days in advance when their award, evaluation etc may be due. In addition, it will track deadlines for services and ZOAREP turn-ins and advise the end user via SMS or email when an item will should surpass its due date.
